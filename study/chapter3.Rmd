This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

*Chapter 3 Data Visulisation*
Firstly, need to load tidyverse
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

This includes *ggplot2* which implements the "grammar of graphics".
ggplot2 includes a sample dataframe called *mpg* (about car gas usage)

```{r}
mpg
```

Creating a graph showing the relationship between engine size *dspl* and fuel efficiency *hwy*

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

Breaking it down
 * ggplot(data = mpg) creates an empty graph
 * geom_point() is for creating a scatterplot
   -> ggplot includes many geom things
 * mapping = aes () is for how it maps
 * aes() is for x and y axis

```{r}
?mpg
